We as a team achieved NYC crime data analysis and visualization on folium maps. We collected NYC crime data from kaggle dataset and performed feature engineering and data cleaning on this dataset. We used two columns latitude and longitude from this data set to display a marker on the map. Further we classified the crime on a high, medium and low scale and displayed them with red, blue and green markers.
Used folium map clustering feature to make the map look clutter free and upon zooming into the map the cluster will expand in multiple marks in the nearby zone. This is all we have achieved in hackbu 2020. Thank you
